# Hook Order Fix Verification ✅

## Issues Fixed:

1. **CollaboratorsPageNew.tsx** - usePagination hook was called after early returns
2. **ResearchPageNew.tsx** - usePagination hook was called after early returns
3. **EventsPageNew.tsx** - usePagination hook was called after early returns

## Root Cause:

React Hooks must be called in the exact same order on every render. When hooks are called conditionally (after early returns for loading/error states), React detects a change in hook order and throws the "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error.

## Solution Applied:

Moved all hook calls (including usePagination) to the top of each component function, before any conditional logic or early returns.

### Before (❌ WRONG):

```tsx
function Component() {
  const [state, setState] = useState();
  const { data, loading, error } = useApi();

  if (loading) return <Loading />; // Early return
  if (error) return <Error />; // Early return

  const { pagination } = usePagination(); // ❌ Called conditionally!
}
```

### After (✅ CORRECT):

```tsx
function Component() {
  const [state, setState] = useState();
  const { data, loading, error } = useApi();
  const { pagination } = usePagination(); // ✅ Called unconditionally!

  if (loading) return <Loading />; // Early return
  if (error) return <Error />; // Early return
}
```

## Status:

- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ All pages working correctly
- ✅ Hook order issues resolved
