## Current Connection Issue ðŸ”§

The MySQL server "HiddenLeaf" is currently rejecting connections from your IP address.

### To Fix This:

1. **Connect to your MySQL server** (via command line or phpMyAdmin)
2. **Update MySQL user permissions**:

   ```sql
   -- Allow connections from your current IP
   CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'takingOff0808!';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

   -- Or create the database manually
   CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS quiri_networking;
   ```

3. **Check MySQL configuration** in `my.cnf` or `my.ini`:
   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   bind-address = 0.0.0.0
   ```

## Next Steps Once Connected:

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### 2. Launch Prisma Studio

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

### 3. Seed Initial Data (Optional)

```bash
npm run seed  # We can create this script
```
